###### three aspects of the exercise that would be different in a real integrated application rather than a toy example

###### NOTE

Hi, there.

It was fun but actualy I haven't used Canvas in my career, it took longer than I expected.
Even though I have an understanding of calculating collision area, problems was
 
1: haven't used AngularJS over an year. (been using React JS for a moment)
2: haven't used Canvas in real world. (never had a chance in real job)

Total spent time is around 2 hours, 
30 minutes to remind AngularJS and set new project.
1 hour to understand how to play with Canvas object.
30 minutes to solve the collision problem.
